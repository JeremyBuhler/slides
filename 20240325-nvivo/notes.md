## Orienting
	- navigation menu has more options in PC - ignore extras
	- stress use of right-click menus
	- that everyting opens in tabs (if lost, look for tabs)

## Importing

During intro, mention that assumes they're using PDFs, but ask if anyone has interviews or spreadsheets.

Mac users will be prompted to edit properties. PC users won't see the file open automatically in the viewing pane. 
	- Ask PC users to double-click to see the file
	- Ask everyone to right-click the entry in the list to edit properties. Explain that this applies to other things like codes as well

## Notes

- Describe Memos and annotations
- No demonstrate memos
- Demonstrate annotations

## Coding

- show screenshot of different Windows interface. Concepts and terminology the same, but interface slightly different
- Windows users not prompted to provide code descriptions or assign color when creating - use code properties after
- in example, create two codes so that can show hierarchy and/or merge later

*ask them to code, address questions*

- show coding stripes
- show code hierarchy
	- Mac, drag and drop
	- Windows, cut and paste
- if code merging required, copy and merge in Mac, then delete; cut and merge in Windows
- show aggregating codes example

*ask to continue coding, to experiment with hierarchy, and to raise questions*

- final section, export codebook (share -> export -> export codebook)

## Zotero import

- After coding, demonstrate Zotero import. Rationale is that you'll be working with multiple files. Using Zotero will make it easier to keep work organized
	- From Zotero, save as RIS file
	- Show that all documents are listed in Files
	- Show that info about all documents is in file classifications
	- No obvious differences between Mac and PC


## Queries

- word frequency query to text search query. Only differences
	- PC has more stemming options
	- location and number of view options
