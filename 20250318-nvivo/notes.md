## Why use NVivo (Jeremy)
Content in slides and from previous presentations

## Menus, navigation (Milan)
No more slides after this point. Students open NVivo and follow along.

- Note that Mac and PC versions have slight differences, but that everything we cover in this workshop is available in both. Encourage students to raise hands if they have questions or need help because their interface is different than what the instructor is sharing. 

- Open NVivo; create new project. Walk them through the setup screens (must name project file and set location first). On PC version there are more options for saving backup copies, etc. (can use default settings for this class).
- Introduce three parts of interface:
	- Navigation pane on left. Everything you import or create in NVivo can be found here.
		- show that in a new file, when you clicking an Navigation item there is text to help you understand what that item is or does.
	- Top menu, which I sometimes refer to as the "actions" menu. To do something like import a file or create a query, look here.
		- show that the menu items change when you click a new header (e.g. "Home", "Import")
	- Central workspace. This is where you will see your imported material, code text, view query results. It's where most of your work happens.

- Three things to stress early on:
	- as you get used to NVivo, don't be afraid to click around and experiment. You can undo up to five recent actions, and trial-and-error can be a helpful way to discover new things
	- I can't stress this enough: learn to use the right-click menu. Almost everything action you can perform from the top menu can also be performed by right-clicking. If you're stuck or not sure where to look, try a right-click and see what options are available from that part of the screen.
 	- mention that in the "central workspace" everying opens in tabs. If you appear to have lost something you were working on, check whether it's in another tab. We'll see examples of this later in the workshop.

## Importing data (Milan)
Invite participants to import their own files if they want to work with those instead. Everyone else will import an interview transcript from the sample project that comes with NVivo, `Barbara.docx`. (Notes below assume the PC version of NVivo.) 

- Go to the "Import" menu. Take a moment to highlight some useful options: "Files" in most cases, "Survey" if you have a spreadsheet. (In the Mac version use "Datasets" for spreadsheets.)
- Ask everyone to follow along: click "Files" and follow the prompts to open the `Barbara.docx` transcript.
- Mention that the "Document properties" box that appears is an opportunity to change how the file is labelled inside your project, and to take other notes about the file. For an interview this might context about the interview that's not recorded in the transcript itself.
	- Changing the file name here does not alter your original file. NVivo makes copies of all the files you import - your originals are never altered from within NVivo.
- Show that the navigation pane is now on the "Files" item, and the transcript is listed as the only file in the project. 
- Double-click the file listing to open it (on Mac this happens automatically). Show that you can drag the vertical divider to make more space for viewing the file.

## Annotation and memos (Milan)

- Briefly introduce the two concepts:
	- annotations are for brief notes, like a comment in the margin of a page or on a post-it note. Annotations are always linked to a passage in your text.
	- memos are like text documents where you can take longer notes; for example, you might have a memo to keep track of how your coding frame develops as you work with your material.
- Ask them to follow along and create one or two annotations:
	- highlight a section of text
	- right-cick, then choose "New annotation"
	- type something, then click back into the document (saves automatically)
- After they create one or two annotations, show how they appear in the document:
	- highlighted
	- can use "Annotations" icon above the document to view list
	- also appear in "Notes > Annotations" item in the Navigation menu. Double-click one of the annotations listed here. 

- Memos also allow you to take notes, but them operate more like text files. 
	- Go to the "Memos" item in the Navigation menu (under Notes)
	- right-click in the memo list (it will be empty to begin with), then select "New memo"
	- Give the memo a name and maybe a description
	- It opens in a new tab (show how the Barbara transcript is still there, but hidden by the new tab).
	- type some text. Like annotations, the memo saves as you go.
- Memos can be linked to other items in NVivo, including files, codes, and cases. This can help keep things organized. Show an example of how to create a memo that's linked to the Barbara transcript (participants don't need to follow along here for this second memo).
	- Go back to the Barbara file
	- Right-click anywhere in the text
	- select Links -> Memo Link -> Link to New Memo...
	- From here the process is the same as before

## Coding (Jeremy)

- show screenshot of different Windows interface. Concepts and terminology the same, but interface slightly different
- Windows users not prompted to provide code descriptions or assign color when creating - use code properties after
- in example, create two codes so that can show hierarchy and/or merge later

*ask them to code, address questions*

- show coding stripes
- show code hierarchy
	- Mac, drag and drop
	- Windows, cut and paste
- if code merging required, copy and merge in Mac, then delete; cut and merge in Windows
- show aggregating codes example

*ask to continue coding, to experiment with hierarchy, and to raise questions*

- final section, export codebook (share -> export -> export codebook)


## Queries (Jeremy)

- word frequency query to text search query. Only differences
	- PC has more stemming options
	- location and number of view options

- matrix coding query
