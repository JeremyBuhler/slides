## Selected research guides

- [Data and Statistics](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/datastatistics)
- [Evaluating Information Sources](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/evaluatingsources)
- [Indigenous Publishers, Distributors & News Media](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/indigenouspublishers)
- [Journalism](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/journalism)
- [Newspaper and News Sources](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/newspapers)


notes: These guides have been created by librarians and have a lot of helpful information and links to relevant resources. The Journalism research guide has most of the links I’ll mention today plus some info about journalism books UBC has. The Newspaper and Indigenous publishers guides will also probably be helpful if you’re looking for news articles or other media. There is also a guide for the microform collection at UBC. If there is one thing I really want you to take away from my visit today, it is the Journalism guide.

_Demo: [Communication & Mass Media Complete](https://resources.library.ubc.ca/page.php?id=596)_

notes:
- topic: social media and political polarization
- search 1: social media AND polarization, 453 results
- search 2: exact phrase, "social media" AND polarization, reduce to 443
- search 3: show filters, limit to peer reviewed and last 5 years
- search 4: show all filters, limit by subject thesauraus, polarization (reduce to 142)
- go back to all filters, show how to remove filters; also that there are more data ranges

## Practice search

    - _Canadian Newsstream_
    - _Factiva_
    - _Nexis Uni_
3. Search for recent news on affordable housing

## Discussion
### How did you refine search results?

notes: synonyms, truncation, limit by publication, limit by geography  

--

### boolan operators

![Slide 21 Image](media\boolean.png)


--

### synonyms

- low-income housing
- subsidized housing
- social housing
- public housing

consider grouping these with the __OR__ operator

--

### truncation

use _afford*_ for
- afford
- affordable
- affordability

but truncation can yield unwanted results (e.g. _hous*_ includes housewife, Houston) 

--

### use advanced search interface

Even Google has one at  
<https://www.google.ca/advanced_search>


Filter by date range, filetype, web domain, etc.

## Searching your own topic

- start with a research question <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- identify topics/themes in your question <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- list search terms for each theme <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- try boolean operators, truncation, filters <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- check search results for new words/phrases <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Evaluating Sources
<https://guides.library.ubc.ca/evaluatingsources>


<ul style="font-size:0.7em" class="fragment">
<li><b>Who</b> wrote the article and what is their background?</li> 
<li><b>What</b> kind of information is it? </li>
<li><b>When</b> was the information published? </li>
<li><b>Where</b> did you find the information? </li>
<li><b>Why</b> was the information published? </li>
<li><b>How</b> is the information accessed?</li>
</ul>

notes: Who – who wrote the article and what is their background? What else have they written?
What – what kind of information is it? Primary or secondary source? Does it include references to works cited?
When – when was the information published? Is it recent? Has it been archived?
Where – where did you find the information? Does it come from a reputable website?
Why – why was the information published? Who is the intended audience? Is there evidence of bias in the information?
How – how is the information accessed? Is it available for free or are there barriers to access (paywall or account required)?
