## Learning objectives

- Distinguish between statistics and microdata 
- Find and navigate StatCan data tables
- Access Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs) 
\

Slides at [https://bit.ly/statcan-data](https://bit.ly/statcan-data)

notes: By the end of the hour you should have an overview of the type of data that's available, where to find it, how to access Public Use Microdata Files (or PUMFs), and where to get help.  
Slides for this presentation are at the link shown here.

The class is narrow in focus - there are many data resources out there, but to keep things manageable we're going to limit it to Statistics Canada data, and we're only covering how to find and download the data, not how to conduct your analysis in SPSS or other software. For support with other data questions you're welcome to contact me or my colleagues at UBC Library (contact info and other resources are listed on the final slide)

_Statistics Canada produces statistical data and insights to help Canadians better understand their country's population, resources, economy, society and culture_  

[https://statcan.gc.ca/about/about](https://statcan.gc.ca/about/about)

notes: Statistics Canada collects and provides data about Canada. The Census is a high profile Statistic Canada data collection activity, but they also compile and provide access to many other datasets, including surveys that are widely used in academic research.

## Statistics vs microdata

Statistics are aggregated data (e.g. counts or percentages, often presented in a table) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Microdata refers to case-level data (e.g. in a survey, results for each respondent)  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes: Before we get too far into the presentation, it's important to have a shared understanding of what we mean by the terms "statistics" and "microdata". 

Published statistical tables can have a lot of informaiton and are excellent if they have the right level of aggregation for your work. But they're not as flexible, you have to work with data that's already grouped a certain way 

With microdata you have the raw material and need to do your own aggregation and analysis, but this gives you more flexibility.

For example, the unemployment rate in August 2025 was 7.1%. The news story cites

## Statistics Canada PUMFs

- **P**ublic **U**se **M**icrodata **F**iles (PUMFs)
- Available in Abacus: <https://abacus.library.ubc.ca>

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="lightblue" -->
## PUMFs and privacy 

- Some variables are suppressed <!-- .element class="fragment" -->  
- Some variables are grouped  <!-- .element class="fragment" --> 
- Sometimes only a sample of responses <!-- .element class="fragment" --> 

notes: PUMFs contain case-level survey and census data, but sensitive variables are removed or aggregated.  
For the Census, only a 2.7% sample is included.  
Researchers needing more detail may need to use a Research Data Centre.

<!-- .slide: data-background="lightblue" -->
## Selected PUMFs in Abacus

- Canadian Community Health Survey
- Canadian Health Survey on Seniors
- Canadian Housing Survey
- Canadian Income Survey
- General Social Survey
- Labour Force Survey  
- Mental Health and Access to Care Survey  
- ... 

notes: A short list of Statistics Canada PUMFs available in Abacus.
