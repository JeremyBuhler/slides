# Outline: presentation for LIBR 559S
Eugene Barsky's class, Jan 17, 2025

Delivered in a week when the class is learning more generally about data in libraries, not RDM-specific. Eugene requests an overview the library's operational data activities. An interactive activity would be good if possible, but not required. Suggested 40 minutes presenting with up to 20 minutes for questions.

## Introduction to Library Data Team

- Jeremy and Meghan introduce themselves
- Slides with content from [Library Data Home](https://confluence.it.ubc.ca/display/ASMNT/Library+Data+Home), and possibly other Confluence pages


## Why is this work needed?

Because the library's data ecosystem is complex and specialized skills and tools help library employees access and use the data more efficiently (or at all)

- External drivers
	- Statistics surveys (what they are, what they claim to be good for)
		- ARL
		- CARL
		- etc
	- Institutional/admin reporting requirements
		- Space needs
		- Report to Senate

- Internal drivers
	- for operational needs
		- spending reports
		- item status/routing reports
		- many collections reports
	- for planning
		- use of collections or equipment
		- change over time, trends in use

## Our role as interpreters

- Library data team acts as a bridge between library operations/employees and the data.
- Involves work similar to reference interviews
- Requires understanding of the library context, as well as the technology/tools involved
- Help library employees understand what's possible
	- potential example: screenshot of a UI interface, then of a SQL query with the same info (to illustrate that we can provide reports when UI or canned reports don't align with operational needs)


## Data sources

- Examples of the kind of data we work with
- Opportunity for interaction (ask class to brainstorm types, write on board)

## Data storage/formats

Possible section on the range of containers or formats
	- in local databases
	- in third party systems w/ limited access
	- in excel
	- collected ourselves


## Example workflows

- Voyager (SQL)
- LibInsight or Google Analtyics (API)
- Seat Counts

In all cases, Tableau as the front end

## Examples of Tableau reports
This could come earlier, or interspersed throughout the presentation

## Questions and discussion
